# adsorbed Xenon propellant storage

Julia code in a Pluto notebook to reproduce all data in the article:

:rocket: Adsorbed xenon propellant storage: are nanoporous materials worth the weight? M. T. Huynh, N. Gantzler, S. Hough, D. Roundy, P. K. Thallapally, C. M. Simon.

the Pluto notebook `xe_propellant_storage.jl` will reproduce all results in our paper. the first line reads the `Project.toml` to install the exact package versions we used to produce the data in our paper.
